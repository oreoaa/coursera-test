        <p id="p1">Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, product design, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development.</p>

        <p id="p2">The architectural design of a system emphasizes the design of the system architecture that describes the structure, behavior and more views of that system and analysis.</p>

        <p id="p3">The logical design of a system pertains to an abstract representation of the data flows, inputs and outputs of the system. This is often conducted via modelling, using an over-abstract (and sometimes graphical) model of the actual system. In the context of systems, designs are included. Logical design includes entity-relationship diagrams (ER diagrams).</p>
